  Clean this academic text to create a script for a professional voice narrator. The final output must be optimized for a smooth, logical, and engaging listening experience.

  CLEANING AND FORMATTING RULES:
  1.  **Front Matter:**
      - KEEP the paper title as the very first line, exactly as it appears. Do NOT delete the title.
      - DELETE the author list, affiliations, and any received/accepted/published dates.
  2.  **Remove All Back Matter:** Delete the entire "Acknowledgements" and "References" sections and any other content after the main body of the paper.
  3.  **Section Headers:**
      - Convert "## ABSTRACT" to "Abstract."
      - Convert other "##" headers to "New section: [Header Name]."
      - Ensure there is a natural-sounding pause after each header.
  4.  **Citations and References:**
      - **CRITICAL:** REMOVE all citation brackets, numbers, and parenthetical references. This includes formats like "[1, 2, 3]", "(Lynch et al. 2012)", and any reference numbers or links.
      - Keep author names only when they are explicitly part of the narrative prose (e.g., "Barrera and Cocks found...").
      - Remove references to figures, tables, and equations (e.g., "as shown in Figure 1", "see Table 2", "from Equation 3").
      - **Do not include any citations or references in the final output.**
  5.  **Symbol and Abbreviation Conversion:**
      - Expand all symbols and technical notations for clear pronunciation:
        - "%" to "percent"
        - "C" to "degrees Celsius"
        - "µm" to "micrometers"
        - "nm" to "nanometers"
        - "BCC" to "Body-Centered Cubic"
        - "FCC" to "Face-Centered Cubic"
        - "kMC" to "kinetic Monte Carlo"
        - "HIPT" to "Hydrogen-Induced Phase Transformation"
        - "HID" to "Hydrogen-Induced Decohesion"
        - "HELP" to "Hydrogen-Enhanced Local Plasticity"
        - "HESIV" to "Hydrogen-Enhanced Strain-Induced Vacancy Formation"
        - "AIDE" to "Adsorption-Induced Dislocation Emission"
        - "SFE" to "Stacking Fault Energy"
      - When an acronym or abbreviation is used for the first time, expand it fully, and then use the acronym afterwards. Example: "Hydrogen embrittlement, abbreviated as H. E., is a complex phenomenon."
  6.  **Punctuation and Flow:**
      - Replace bullet points with fluid, prose-like sentences or lists that flow naturally.
      - Expand common abbreviations like "i.e." to "that is," and "e.g." to "for example."
      - Break up extremely long sentences into shorter, more digestible phrases.
      - Use paragraph breaks between major sections and topic transitions for natural pacing.
      - Do NOT insert any pause tags, markup tags, or special annotations. Use only plain prose.

  CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
  - DO NOT lose any scientific content, data points, or key findings. The information must remain scientifically accurate and complete.
  - The final script should be a fluid, continuous narrative, free of any artifacts that betray its origin as a written document.
  - The final output must contain only the cleaned and formatted text of the paper's body.
  - Output ONLY the processed text. Do NOT include any instructions, acknowledgements, or requests for input.
